abstract = {Energy is vital for sustainable development of any nation – be it social, economic or environment. In the past decade energy consumption has increased exponentially globally. Energy management is crucial for the future economic prosperity and environmental security. Energy is linked to industrial production, agricultural output, health, access to water, population, education, quality of life, etc. Energy demand management is required for proper allocation of the available resources. During the last decade several new techniques are being used for energy demand management to accurately predict the future energy needs. In this paper an attempt is made to review the various energy demand forecasting models. Traditional methods such as time series, regression, econometric, ARIMA as well as soft computing techniques such as fuzzy logic, genetic algorithm, and neural networks are being extensively used for demand side management. Support vector regression, ant colony and particle swarm optimization are new techniques being adopted for energy demand forecasting. Bottom up models such as MARKAL and LEAP are also being used at the national and regional level for energy demand management.}

author = {Ying Fan and Lan-Cui Liu and Gang Wu and Yi-Ming Wei},
keywords = {STIRPAT model, CO emissions, Partial least squares regression},
abstract = {Using the STIRPAT model, this paper analyzes the impact of population, affluence and technology on the total CO2 emissions of countries at different income levels over the period 1975–2000. Our main results show at the global level that economic growth has the greatest impact on CO2 emissions, and the proportion of the population between ages 15 and 64 has the least impact. The proportion of the population between 15 and 64 has a negative impact on the total CO2 emissions of countries at the high income level, but the impact is positive at other income levels. This may illustrate the importance of the “B” in the “I=PABT”; that is to say that different behavior fashions can greatly influence environmental change. For low-income countries, the impact of GDP per capita on total CO2 emissions is very great, and the impact of energy intensity in upper-middle income countries is very great. The impact of these factors on the total CO2 emissions of countries at the high income level is relatively great. Therefore, these empirical results indicate that the impact of population, affluence and technology on CO2 emissions varies at different levels of development. Thus, policy-makers should consider these matters fully when they construct their long-term strategies for CO2 abatement.}
